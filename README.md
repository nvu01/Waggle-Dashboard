# Waggle Power BI Dashboard: Lapdog vs. Lapcat Analysis

This Power BI report analyzes user and pet data from Waggle, a pet-tech startup known for its smart devices. 
Following the success of the Lapdog fitness collar for dogs, Waggle launched a field test of its feline counterpart, the Lapcat. 
This dashboard helps stakeholders understand how the new device is performing and whether it justifies further development.

## Business Requirements

CEO's Key Questions:
- Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing Lapcat, similar to dogs with Lapdog?
- Were Lapcat owners as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

Product Team Expectations:
The product team trusts the analyst to incorporate additional insights and visualizations as needed, but is especially interested in:
- Demographic comparisons between dogs and cats using Waggle devices
- Insights about the families who own the pets
